# A Basic Allocator

This package includes a home-grown memory allocator written entirely in Rust. It
is simple, and meant primarily for educational purposes.

This crate is heavily commented and documented. See the
[documentation](https://docs.rs/basic_allocator) or [the code
itself](https://github.com/wackywendell/basicalloc) for more details.
